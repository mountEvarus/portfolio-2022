# Portfolio 2022

## Description

This is my 2022 frontend-focused portfolio, showing off some of the skills I have learnt in the last 2 years of working as a software engineer. 

I have a breif "about me" seciton on the homepage, a page with my most recent projects & a contact page complete with email, social media links & my CV.

This project also has a dark mode theme toggle which can be found in the right hand side of the header. The preference is stored in local storage, so once you've set it, it will be remembered on the next visit.
